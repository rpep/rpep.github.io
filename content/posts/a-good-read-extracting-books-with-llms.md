The BBC has an excellent radio programme called '[A Good Read](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v8jn)'. It first started 1977, and there have been hundreds of episodes, each of which has several celebrities and authors recommending a book each along with the host. Many episodes (though not all, the online archive goes back to roughly the early 1990s) are hosted for free to listen to on the BBC Sounds website. I often like to listen to it, but couldn't find anywhere that the books had been recommended were listed online. Because it's been around a long time, the format of the descriptions isn't consistent and at different points in time, there have been for e.g. more books recommended than at others. I decided to have a try and using Llama locally on my Macbook Pro M2 to try and extract the information. The source code for this post is [here](http://github.com/rpep/a-good-read).


```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests
import ollama
import textwrap
import tqdm
import json
import time
import pandas as pd
from itertools import chain
```

I decided that perhaps the best chance of extracting the information was to pull the long form description of each episode. By doing this, we can extract all the information necessary, but throw away lots of extraneous additional information, reducing the size of the context the LLM would receive. Because the back episodes are hosted on BBC iPlayer, I first had to scrape the actual URLs for each episode of a programme. Each programme has a URL key that describes it, so the following method will scrape the paginated list and return the URLs for each episode:

```python
def find_episodes(programme_id):
    """
    For a programme on BBC iPlayer with a URL:
    https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006v8jn/episodes/player?page=1
    the ID is "b006v8jn"
    """
    page = 0
    urls_list = []
    while True:
        page += 1
        url = f"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/{programme_id}/episodes/player?page={page}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        if response.status_code == 200:
            html = response.content.decode("UTF-8")
            soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
            episodes = soup.find_all("div", class_="programme__body", recursive=True)
            if len(episodes) == 0:
                break
            else:
                for episode in episodes:
                    url = episode.h2.a.attrs['href']
                    urls_list.append(url)
        else:
            break
    return urls_list
    
```


```python
urls_list = find_episodes("b006v8jn")
```

Checking that this has worked, we can see that it's pulled the episode list and identified 670 episodes as of the 21st June 2024.

```python
len(urls_list)
```

    670

The next step is to try and grab the descriptions. This proved to be a bit challenging as the pages have changed in content over time, but I was able to identify that on newer pages, the description was contained within a `div` called 'synopsis-toggle__long'. On older pages, it was contained within a div called 'longest-synopsis'. The following code just grabs the description text and strips out superflous newline characters:

```python
texts = []
for url in urls_list:
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("error")
    html = response.content.decode("UTF-8")
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    text = soup.find("div", class_="synopsis-toggle__long")
    if not text:
        text = soup.find("div", class_="longest-synopsis")
    if not text:
        print(f"skipping url {url}")
        break
    text = text.get_text().replace("\n", " ").lstrip().rstrip()
    texts.append(text)
```

The list of episodes goes from most recent to oldest, so checking that everything worked, we can see that we've got here the episode description for [this](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m00209gs) episode which had Denise Mina and Simon Brett as guests.

```python

```

Itâ€™s a story without any detective and one that, perhaps, reveals a more personal side to Christie's writing.  Denise Mina (most recently: Three Fires, The Second Murderer) picks In the Garden of the Fugitives by South African-Australian author Ceridwen Dovey, an epistolary novel which begins with a letter that breaks seventeen years of silence between a rich, elderly man with a broken heart and his former protegee, a young South African filmmaker.  And for the occasion of having two crime authors, Harriett Gilbert picks a golden age crime book, Hide My Eyes by Margery Allingham, where private detective Albert Campion finds himself hunting down a serial killer.

The hard part now is trying to extract the books. For this, I provide a prompt to the LLM, and instruct it to extract them, giving an example of the JSON format I would like it to return, using Llama 3's 8B instruct model and the very easy to set up [ollama](https://ollama.com/) to interface with it from Python. The system prompt below went through many iterations to get something that worked reliably, as I found that often superflous fields would appear in the JSON, the titles and authors were badly formatted or missing, authors were confused with the people recommending them, or books weren't found at all. I think that the common refrain I've seen people working with LLMs say of "it's easy to get to 80%, but getting to >95% takes much much longer" certainly matches my experience.

```python
responses = []
for i, text in tqdm.tqdm(enumerate(texts)):
    response = json.loads(
        ollama.chat(
            model='llama3:8b-instruct-q4_0',
            messages=[
                {
                    'role': 'system',
                    'content': textwrap.dedent(
                        """\

```

The execution time for this was, as measured by TQDM, roughly 30 minutes for all 670 text descriptions.

Grabbing the books themselves, we can see that we've found 1986. Older episodes have four books recommended, while newer ones have three, so this sounds roughly right.


```python
books = [r['books'] for r in responses]
books = list(chain.from_iterable(books))
len(books)
```

```text
1986
``````

We can dump the list to a file:


```python
f = open("books.json", 'w')
f.write(json.dumps(books))
```

Briefly inspecting this, we can see that we've mostly accurately pulled the books from the latest few episodes.

     "QUARTET IN AUTUMN by Barbara Pym, chosen by Samantha Harvey MRS CALIBAN by Rachel Ingalls, chosen by Harriett GilbertPHARMACOPOEIA: A DUNGENESS NOTEBOOK by Derek Jarman, chosen by Darran Anderson Two award-winning writers share books they love with Harriett Gilbert. Samantha Harvey is the author of five novels, The Wilderness, All Is Song, Dear Thief ,The Western Wind and, most recently, Orbital. She is also the author of a memoir, The Shapeless Unease: A Year of Not Sleeping. Her choice of a good read is a slim novel by Barbara Pym set in 1970s London about the lives of four single people in their sixties who work in an office together. Quartet in Autumn is sharply perceptive about the ways in which we hide from one other and from ourselves. Darran Anderson is an Irish writer who lives in London. He is the author of Imaginary Cities: A Tour of Dream Cities, Nightmare Cities, and Everywhere in Between; a memoir, Inventory, about growing up during the Troubles; and the forthcoming In the Land of My Enemy. His choice, Pharmacopoeia, brings together fragments of the artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman's writing on nature, gardening and Prospect Cottage, his Victorian fisherman's hut on the shingle at Dungeness.  Harriett's choice is a fantastically strange novel by Rachel Ingalls, published in 1982. In Mrs Caliban, a grieving housewife in a loveless marriage embarks on a heady affair with a green-skinned frogman.  Produced by Mair Bosworth for BBC Audio  Show less",

Kathryn chooses Flaubert's Parrot by Julian Barnes, an exploration of the French writer's life in the form of a novel. Dan's choice is very different - John Higgs taking on the conceptual artists and chart toppers The KLF. Harriett has gone for Michael Ondaatje's novel Warlight, set in a murky and mysterious post-war London. Presenter: Harriett Gilbert Producer for BBC Audio Bristol: Sally Heaven  Show less"]
